# EuPathGalaxy
VEuPathDB features offered in the [VEuPathDB Galaxy](https://veupathdb.globusgenomics.org/) website, a free, interactive, web-based platform for large-scale data analysis.

Instructions to access this website from our VEuPathDB sites, at [VEuPathDB Galaxy orientation](https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/galaxy-orientation).

It provides our own home page, and includes the VEuPathDB written (1) tools for exporting data to our VEuPathDB sites, and (2) workflows to generate data that can be exported to our VEuPathDB sites.

[VEuPathDB Galaxy](https://veupathdb.globusgenomics.org/) website is built on the software developed by the [Galaxy Project](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) (this is the [Galaxy public website](https://usegalaxy.org/)). Our galaxy site is maintained by [Globus Genomics](https://globusgenomics.org/).

## Description

With VEuPathDB Galaxy you can:
1. Start analyzing your data now with pre-configured workflows. All VEuPathDB genomes are pre-loaded.
1. Perform large-scale data analysis with no prior programming or bioinformatics experience.
1. Use dataset Collections, to process multiple samples in parallel and/or to group paired-end files. [Learn about Galaxy Collections](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/collections/).
1. Create custom workflows using an interactive workflow editor. [Learn how](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/AdvancedWorkflow).
1. Export your results to VEuPathDB, so that you can explore your data with our tools, such as JBrowse and search strategies. See this [Export tutorial](https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/VEuPathDB_RNAseq_export.pdf).
1. View your results on Galaxy or download results to your computer.
1. Keep data private, or share data with colleagues or the community.
